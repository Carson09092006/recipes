    ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package German chocolate cake mix
        <li>1 ¼ cups water
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil
        <li>3 large eggs
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk
        <li>2 cups hot fudge topping
        <li>1 (12 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed
        <li>4 (1.4 ounce) bars English toffee-flavored candy, crushed
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch glass baking dish.
        <li>Mix cake mix, water, oil, and eggs in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined. Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and set the baking dish on a wire rack.
        <li>While the cake is still very warm, poke holes all over the top with the end of a wooden spoon. Pour condensed milk over cake and let cool, 20 to 30 minutes.
        <li>Pour hot fudge topping over cooled cake and let set, 20 to 30 minutes.
        <li>Spread whipped topping over top and sprinkle with crushed toffee.
    </ol>
